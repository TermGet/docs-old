# First Time Setup On Linux, BSD, ChromeOS, and MacOS.

After installing, run TermGet using

    termget

If you installed TermGet without detection of the package manager, or package manager detection didn't work, you should get a message that sort of looks like this:

    Please choose a package manager

    1. apt-get (For Debian, and Debian based systems.)
    2. xbps (For Void Linux, and Void Linux based systems)
    3. dnf (For Fedora, and Fedora based systems)
    4. zypper (For OpenSUSE, and OpenSUSE based systems)
    5. eopkg (For Solus, and Solus based systems)
    6. pacman (For Arch, and Arch based systems)
    .....list goes on

Choose your distribution's package manager using the number. My package manager is eopkg, so I would type "5" and press enter. 

If you are on MacOS type ```11``` for homebrew.
If you are on ChromeOS type ```10``` for chromebrew.
